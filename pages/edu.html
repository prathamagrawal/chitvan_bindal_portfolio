        <h1 class="role"><b>MY ROLE</b></h1>
        <p class="roledes" >While we worked in a group of three on the entire project, we used the strategy “Divide &<br>
            Conquer” by assigning sections  on an individual basis and then reviewing together to create an<br>  outstanding product.<br>
            I worked mostly on the big summary of the game including educational objectives, creating<br>
            personas, conducting market analysis, proposing game rules and describing the logic model of<br>
            the game based on cognitive, affective, social & narrative design principles. </p>
        <h1 class="introduction"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h1>
        <p class="intodes" >
            For Context the state government gave our company Gaming Inc. the contract of designing a<br>
            game on waste management and of launching a long-term competition (based on the game)<br>
            with a prize money - an educational scholarship of $1000. The game is targeted to promote an<br>
            attitudinal shift towards green habits amongst the middle school students in the long term.<br>
            &emsp; We are currently living in a world where environmental sustainability is at the forefront of<br>
            the future. An environmental crisis looms in our lives and every person can do their part to<br>
            make sure that our environment is clean, even in the smallest daily activities. This game wants<br>
            to teach students what they can do in their lives, now and in the future, to help the world. The<br>
            main idea of this game is to teach about the key parts of reuse, reduce, and recycle in real life<br>
            scenarios and bring a behavioral & attitudinal change in their actions. Players will go through<br>
            the game and learn what products to recycle, what products can be reused, and what products<br>
            must be thrown away. The players already know the concept of recycling but they do not know<br>
            how to apply it in the real world. So, the purpose of our game is to apply the knowledge they<br>
            already possess and take actions.
